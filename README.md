# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
The dataset contains data of various clients of a bank involved in marketing data. Our aim is to predict if the client will subscribe to a fixed term deposit or not denoted with feature y in the dataset. 
Dataset - https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv
The model which performed well on the given dataset was AutoML with 0.9168 accuracy than Hyperdrive model with accuracy 0.9107.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**
**Setting Up Training Script**
Firstly, The libraries were imported then dataset in csv format was imported through specified URL using TabularDatasetFactory. Then running training script where clean_data function is used for cleaning and one hot encode the data. With train_test_split function, the data is splitted into training and testing with test size 0f 0.3. 
**HyperDrive Pipeline**


**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**

## Proof of cluster clean up
**If you did not delete your compute cluster in the code, please complete this section. Otherwise, delete this section.**
